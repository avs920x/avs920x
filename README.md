## Hi there 👋

👋 About Me

Hi there! I’m Audrey Schmitt, a Business and Data Analyst with a background in government consulting, digital transformation, and analytics. I’ve spent over seven years working with SharePoint Online and about four years building solutions in the Microsoft Power Platform (Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, and Dataverse).

I’m passionate about using technology and data to simplify complex processes, uncover insights, and make work more efficient. I also enjoy learning new tools and experimenting with analytics and automation—whether in Power BI, Tableau, or Python.


🌍 Fun Facts

I have a deep interest in how data and psychology intersect, especially in understanding human behavior. I am also interested in health data and patterns you can decipher from healthcare data. Additionally, I am interested in e-learning data, real estate data, and cultural analytics. 

I’m currently pursuing a Graduate Certificate in Data Science and have recently completed the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analyst program.

I love exploring different cultures, studying languages, and have plans to become a digital nomad in the near future. 

Outside of tech, I enjoy volunteering and staying active and healthy. 


💼 Open to Collaboration

I’m interested in collaborating on outsourcing or freelance analytics and automation projects, especially those involving:

Data visualization and reporting.
Power Platform and SharePoint development.
Data cleaning, integration, and process improvement.

If your team needs a motivated, detail-oriented collaborator for data, automation, or dashboard projects — feel free to reach out!
